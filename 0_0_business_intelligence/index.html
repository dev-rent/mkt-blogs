  <section id="introduction">
    <p>The most popular business model of the last decade might very well be the <em>marketplace ecosystem business model</em>, graciously adopted by Apple, Microsoft, Google and many more. The main idea is providing all services a user might need, via a store with a subscription model, and typically only working well within it's own ecosystem. If a provider can successfully lock-in customers, they are likely to stay for a long time.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, this business model does not align with the flexibility startups and scaleups need, and usually, comes at quite a premium. And once a company decides a provider, getting out proves to be quite difficult.</p>

    <p>In this article, we review the concept of business intelligence (BI), talk about the must-knows before engaging in ecosystems and provide tips and insights on how to remain flexible and prevent locking yourself in.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-blog">What is Business Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/business-intelligence" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IBM</a>, business intelligence (BI) is the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Business intelligence (BI) is a <strong class="cfo-tip">set of technological processes</strong> for collecting, managing and analyzing organizational data <strong class="cfo-tip">to yield insights that inform business strategies and operations</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In practice, we associate it with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making within an organization.</li>
      <li>Enabling business users to access different types of data, historical and current, third-party and in-house, as well as semistructured data and unstructured data such as social media.</li>
      <li>Analysing this information to gain insights into how the business is performing and what it should do next.</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>BI tools are essential to every business, small or large, as they allow for easy and advanced analytics of data generated by your company. Whether it is stock rotation, sales insights or financial overview, BI tools will help grow your organisation.</p>

  <section id="data">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Data is an Asset, not Residual Product</h2>
    <p>Whether your business generates loads or little data, it should be treated as an asset with future value, through insight or sale. So before locking yourself in a commercial ecosystem, consider the following: <strong class="cfo-tip">would you rather maintain your data, or have it maintained?</strong></p>

    <p>In a simplified data management pipeline, we identify a <em>source</em>, <em>staging area</em>, <em>database</em> and <em>front-end</em>. The source data is typicaly one of three: public, self-generated or bought. The rest is typically hidden behind some software setup.</p>
    
    <p>But let us focus for a moment on the database. A database is the virtual equivalent of an old-school archive. It's basically a collection of tables or spreadsheets with information. That is why commercial ecosystems are eager to limit or close off access to databases, which automatically binds you to their ecosystem. Ironically, however, virtually <strong class="cfo-tip">all closed ecosystems allow for connection with external databases</strong>. So getting you data from your own database into Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheet or any other technology, is practically guaranteed.</p>

    <p>This proposes an interesting new take on how to you should handle your data. Rather than locking it behind someone else's door, why not maintain a database yourself and keep your managing rights on the original data without too many barriers if you want to move from M365 to Google, or the other way around?</p>
    
    <p>Technology today allows for no-code users to achieve this easily, but first a short word on data types.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">Data Type Matters</h3>
    <p>All data is stored in a type. The best-known text data types are <em>DOCX</em> or <em>XLSX</em> but you've likely heard of other types like <em><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Comma Separated Value (CSV) is typically used for tabular data. The first row defines the columns and every row after holds the corresponding data, separated by commas.">CSV</span></em> or <em><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) follows a more dictionary-type structure, where key-value pairs exist. E.g. {'name': 'CFOrent'} or {'years': [2024, 2025, 2026]}">JSON</span></em> as well. The latter two are non-proprietary data types and allow for data sharing across virtually every known technology. So it makes sense, to default to storing captured data in one of those two data types.</p>
    
    <h3 class="h3-blog">Easy Does It (Every Time)</h3>
    <p>DBaaS (database-as-a-service) like <a href="https://supabase.com/pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Supabase</a> or <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mongo DB</a> provide no-code solutions for database management and allow for simplest form of data management, with free tiers to exeriment with. And they can handle CSV/JSON.</p>

    <p>If you have ever succesfully installed a step-by-step installation, you can aim higher and continue with <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pgAdmin</a> or <a href="https://postgresapp.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Postgres.app</a> (macOS). Combine this one of the cloud database solutions, such as <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href="https://www.linode.com/products/databases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linode</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/database/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS</a>. All providers have a vast library on <em>how-to</em> guides.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong class="cfo-tip">IT Insight</strong>: <strong>choose your difficulty</strong>
      <p>The most common type of database is a relational database. Through dividing data into categories (tables), you provide each row with an unique ID and then link data from one table to another. Kind of similar as the children's puzzle of connecting two associative words together.</p>

      <p>Upcoming is the document-oriented database. Rather than breaking down your data, you store it as a document. To prevent hassling with data types to much, defaulting to CSV/JSON or <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is an all-round text data type. It was the base for webpages (HTML)and accounting data (XBRL), and is a type that allows for many various purposes.">XML</span> is a smart choice.</p>

      <p>Supabase is probably one of the lowest-barriers solutions for exploring ways to maintain your own data. But users with more agile needs might outgrow is relatively quickly.</p>
      <p>For them, DigitalOcean's Postgres DB might offer more flexibility without the need of a Master's degree in an IT-related field.</p>

      <p>And so the <em>pick 'n' choose</em> can start. Want it easy, go for Supabase or Document-oriented databases. Can you handle a challenge, then Postgres combined with a service provider will bring you <em>very</em> far. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RTFM</a>.</p>

  <section id="examples">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Connect to All</h2>
    <p>Where you take it from here, really depends on what you want to realise. A quick Google search "how to connect database to X" or a friendly prompt on your favourite AI-chatbot, will give some inspiration. But if you want more concrete examples, consider the following examples:</p>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">Microsoft and PowerBI</h3>
    <p>Microsoft's Power Query allows for the Extraction, Transforming and Loading (ETL) of your data, and connect it to Excel, PowerBI or other M365 products. While dashboarding is useful, you should focus on key data points you'd like to track. Whether it is sales-related, stock-related or something else, be sure not to over-engineer dashboards, as they will quickly loose their purposes. Better five categorised dashboards with two or three parameters than one with all!</p>

  <section id="">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Savings vs Strategy</h2>
    <p>Gaining more control over your data is not necessarily a saving but rather asset management. As we opened this article, we've discussed the <em>marketplace ecosystem business model</em>. Nowadays, in some cases, this sales models starts to lose it's value to the customer.</p>

    <p>By forcing add-on sales or subscription licenses, only those who can afford them are likely to use them. But have a look at all the tools you leave aside because they are too expensive, or that you don't use because they are out of the ecosystem. Google offers a lot of free solutions, but those products come with a hidden price as well, namely loss of <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="While it is very unlikely that Google will sell data from your spreadsheet, it is very likely that they do use your data for internal development. It's up to you to decide how comfortable you are with that.">secrets</span>, and a huge amount of sharing user analytics data via your browser.</p>

    <p>But the real strategic importance of gaining more control over your own data, is that it allows for way more flexibility and fine grained control over software licenses and ecosystem setups. An example:</p>

    <table class="dept-software">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Department</th>
          <th>Primary Software</th>
          <th>Vendor</th>
          <th>Typical Use</th>
          <th>Connection to Own Database</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Sales</td>
          <td>Salesforce Sales Cloud</td>
          <td>Salesforce</td>
          <td>CRM, pipeline management</td>
          <td>Bi-directional sync via API / ODBC</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Accounting</td>
          <td>SAP S/4HANA</td>
          <td>SAP</td>
          <td>General ledger, invoicing, reporting</td>
          <td>Direct connector / ETL</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Marketing</td>
          <td>HubSpot</td>
          <td>HubSpot</td>
          <td>Campaigns, leads, attribution</td>
          <td>API sync (read/write)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>HR</td>
          <td>Workday HCM</td>
          <td>Workday</td>
          <td>Payroll, contracts, absences</td>
          <td>Scheduled export/import</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Operations</td>
          <td>Microsoft Power BI</td>
          <td>Microsoft</td>
          <td>Analytics, dashboards</td>
          <td>Live query to internal DB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Management</td>
          <td>Tableau</td>
          <td>Salesforce (Tableau)</td>
          <td>Executive reporting</td>
          <td>Read-only analytics connection</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>So as a closing argument for this article: look at the variety of vendors in the table, and look at the potential spread of your data over these ecosystems. One can only hope that vendor A allows for a connection with vendor B, because if not, you are likely to pay up for that additional license within the ecosystem. Unless...</p>
