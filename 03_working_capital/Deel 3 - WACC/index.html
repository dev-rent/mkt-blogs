  <section id="introduction">
    <p>Welcome to our third and final article in the Mastering Working Capital series! In this instalment, we'll dive into the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC.</p>

    <p>WACC is a <span class="cfo-tip">powerful metric for evaluating investments</span>, giving insights into whether new projects will meet the minimum return required by both equity and debt stakeholders. This metric reflects <span class="cfo-tip">the full scope of a company's capital structure</span> by considering loans, shareholders' equity, required returns, and corporate tax deductions. While best known for investment analysis, WACC is versatile—it can also inform decisions in areas like expansion, R&D, and long-term funding strategies.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A firm's weighted average cost of capital has important applications other than the discount rate in capital project evaluations. For instance, it is a key ingredient to measure a firm's true economic profit, or what I like to call EVA, standing for economic value added. [...] Starting in the early 1990s, firms around the world—ranging from Coca-Cola, to Briggs & Stratton, Herman Miller, and Eli Lilly in America, Siemens in Germany, Tata Consulting and the Godrej Group out of India, Brahma Beer in Brazil, and many, many more—began to turn to EVA as a new and better way to measure performance and set goals, make decisions and determine bonuses, and to communicate with investors and to teach business and finance basics to managers and employees. Properly tailored and implemented, EVA is a natural way to bring the cost of capital to life and to turn everyone in a company into a capital conscientious, owner-entrepreneur.</p>

  <section id="wacc-formula">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Inside the WACC Formula: Key Components Explained</h2>

    <p>The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents the minimum return rate a company needs to achieve on its invested capital to meet the expectations of its investors and cover its overall financing costs. WACC serves as <span class="cfo-tip">a benchmark, guiding decision-makers</span> in assessing the profitability of both current activities and potential future investments.</p>

    <p>However, it's crucial to remember that WACC isn't a 'one-size-fits-all' metric; each use case requires a distinct calculation based on specific circumstances, such as industry factors, capital structure, and project-specific risks. Let's start by examining the individual components of the WACC formula.</p>

    <div class="latex">$$\text{WACC}=(\frac {E}{V}) * R_{E} + (\frac {D}{V}) * R_{D} * (1 - T_{C})$$</div>

    <p><em>With:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><sup>E</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> = the <span class="tooltip">capital structure weight<span class="tooltip-text">The proportion of financing type used by a company, commonly split in equity and debt.</span></span> of equity.</li>
      <li><sup>D</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> = the capital structure weight of debt.</li>
      <li>V = market value</li>
      <li>R<sub>E</sub> = Cost of equity</li>
      <li>R<sub>D</sub> = Cost of debt</li>
      <li>T<sub>C</sub> = Corporate tax rate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the market value, not the accounting value. Market values provide a more accurate snapshot of the current costs of capital than historical, book-based accounting value</li>
      <li>Ensure each component represents funds currently used in operations or earmarked for future investments, reflecting the actual sources of capital in the company's financing structure</li>
      <li>Always calculate the debt factor <span class="tooltip">after-tax<span class="tooltip-text" style="width: 400px;">Just like mortgage interest, corporate loan interest is tax deductible.<br>For example, if a loan's interest rate is 8%, the after-tax cost is calculated as 8% * (1 - T<sub>C</sub>), where T<sub>C</sub> is the corporate tax rate.<br><strong>Example Calculation:</strong><br>Interest rate = 8% <br>Corporate Tax Rate is 25%<br>E.g. 8% * (1 - 25%) = <strong>6%</strong></span></span>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A simple example: if the WACC for an investment is, say 6%. Then that serves as the required return rate to maintain the company's value relative to its capital costs. If we plan to invest €1,000, then the cost of capital will be €60, calculated as follows: 1,000 * (1 + 0.06) = 1,060.</p>

    <p><em>Note: In this article, we'll simplify calculations to focus on when and how to use WACC. <span class="cfo-tip">In practice, calculating WACC is more complex</span>, often requiring financial experts who analyse various funding sources and their associated costs. We'll illustrate these principles with a fictional, publicly traded company, AB Bieren N.V.</em></p>

  <section id="influences">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Know the Influences Impacting WACC</h2>
    <p>AB Bieren N.V. plans to open a new production line in Belgium to expand its capacity, with an estimated investment of <span id="investmentText">5 M</span>. Understanding the composition of its capital structure allows us to calculate a tailored WACC, factoring in both equity and debt costs.</p>

    <p>For this project, AB Bieren N.V. plans to fund <span id="ev_weight">50</span>% (<span id="stockAmount">2.5 M</span>) through issuing new stock and the remaining <span id="dv_weight">50</span>%(<span id="loanAmount">2.5 M</span>) via a bank loan. New shareholders are promised a <span id="costEq">15</span>% return, reflecting the higher risk typically associated with equity. On the debt side, the bank, which requires lower returns on secured loans, will charge a <span id="costDebt">4.5</span>% interest rate. The current Belgian corporate tax rate is 25%, which will affect the after-tax cost of debt in our WACC calculation.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>With a WACC of <span id="wacc_result">0</span>, the minimum return from the new production line must be <span id="min_return">0</span>.<br>AB Bieren now needs to evaluate whether they can achieve this minimum return—and ideally exceed it to generate profit. <span class="cfo-tip">Enter the Net Present Value (NPV).</span></p>

    <p>NPV will help AB Bieren determine if the project's returns justify the investment, using WACC as the discount rate. The company anticipates a 10-year service life for the production line, with an annual net cash inflow of <span id="gross_cash_flow">2,000,000</span> and costs of <span id="cost_cash_flow">1,250,000</span>, resulting in an annual Net Cash Flow of <span id="net_cash_flow">750,000</span>.</p>

    <p>The NPV formula is as follows:</p>
      
    <div class="latex">$$\text{NPV} = \text{present value of expected returns}-\text{cost investment}$$</div>
    
    <p>The present value of expected returns is projected to be <span id="present_value">0</span>, leaving an NPV of <span id="npv">0</span>.</p>

    <p>According to theory, AB Bieren should proceed with the investment <span class="cfo-tip">if the NPV is positive or zero</span>, as this indicates that the return meets or exceeds the WACC. <span class="cfo-tip">However, a negative NPV</span> suggests the investment may not achieve the required returns and could be reconsidered.</p>

  <section id="leveraging-debt">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Leveraging debt</h2>

    <p>Despite a negative NPV, AB Bieren is committed to launching the new production line, confident that the market demand justifies the investment. By revisiting their financing options, AB Bieren adjusts the capital structure to a 40-60 split: 40% from equity (investors) and 60% from debt. <span class="cfo-tip">Try it yourself and notice how this change impacts the NPV.</span></p>

    <p>Additionally, just on 17 october 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced plans to <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2024/html/ecb.mp241017~aa366eaf20.en.html#:~:text=ECB%20interest%20rates-,The%20Governing%20Council%20today%20decided%20to%20lower%20the%20three%20key,effect%20from%2023%20October%202024." target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower the interest rates</a>, giving AB Bieren leverage to renegotiate its loan rate down to 4%. With these adjustments, the NPV turns positive, reaching €78,277, allowing AB Bieren to green-light the project. This approach is known as "<span class="cfo-tip">leveraging debt</span>”—a strategy used to enhance returns by increasing debt financing when conditions are favourable. However, it's essential to manage debt levels carefully, as too much leverage introduces higher financial risk.</p>

    <p>Notice how these changes also impact the WACC. This sensitivity to factors like capital structure and interest rates underscores the importance of WACC and its components. <span class="cfo-tip">Getting WACC right is crucial for a company to make sound investment decisions</span>. Yet, one final insight remains unseen in the WACC formula: the cost of capital hinges more on the <em>use</em> of funds than their source. For instance, capital allocated to high-growth projects may justify a higher WACC, while low-risk investments may require a lower threshold. This focus on <span class="cfo-tip">purpose over origin</span> highlights that strategic, effective use of capital is the true driver of sustainable returns and value creation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="cfo-tip">CFOrent-tip</span>: "<strong>A good practice</strong> is to make simulations of the WACC, where you incorporate various macro-economic factors that might influence the  WACC. This way, we can create a better risk-profile for the  investment." Says Anthony, CFOrent associate. "However, the WACC  cannot be the only metric to consider. In the end, a clear vision  statement determines what investments really matter for a company.  The metrics are merely tools to fine-tune the investment and to make an educated decision."</p>

  <section id="balancing-equity-debt">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Balancing Shareholder Equity and Debt in WACC</h2>
    <p>In calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), a company's capital structure—its mix of shareholder equity and debt—plays a critical role. <span class="cfo-tip">Let's explore why companies use a combination</span> of these financing sources, and how each affects the cost of capital.</p>

    <p><span class="cfo-tip">Shareholder equity represents the ownership stake</span> in a company. When a company raises capital by issuing shares, it gives investors a claim on future profits. In return, shareholders expect a certain rate of return, or cost of equity, which reflects the level of risk they're taking. The cost of equity tends to be higher than the cost of debt, as shareholders assume greater risk: unlike lenders, they are paid only after all debts are settled and receive returns based on performance.</p>

    <p>While equity doesn't require fixed repayments like debt, it carries an implicit cost—the returns shareholders expect for their investment. This expectation is part of the WACC formula, and it reflects the “price” a company pays to retain investor support and avoid diluting ownership.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">Why Use Debt? The Power of Leverage</h3>
    <p>Debt, on the other hand, offers an alternative financing path. Unlike equity, <span class="cfo-tip">debt requires regular interest payments but provides several advantages</span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower Cost: Debt generally has a lower cost than equity because lenders assume less risk. They have a contractual right to repayment, often backed by collateral, and are typically first in line during any liquidation process.</li>
      <li>Tax Deductibility: Interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, reducing the company's overall tax burden. This tax advantage lowers the effective cost of debt in the WACC formula, making it an attractive option for many companies.</li>
      <li>Controlled Ownership: Unlike issuing shares, debt does not dilute existing ownership, allowing current shareholders to maintain control over the company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">The Balance Between Equity and Debt</h3>
    <p>Finding <span class="cfo-tip">the right balance between shareholder equity and debt is key</span> to managing WACC effectively. While debt can lower WACC due to its lower cost and tax benefits, excessive debt can increase financial risk, potentially affecting credit ratings, operational flexibility, and shareholder confidence. On the other hand, too much reliance on equity may increase WACC, as equity holders expect a higher return. In the WACC calculation, the cost of equity and cost of debt are weighted according to their proportion in the company's capital structure. By optimizing this balance, companies can achieve a lower WACC, making it easier to pursue growth opportunities with more favourable returns.</p>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>In understanding the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), we've seen that it is far more than a simple metric. WACC serves as a guiding compass for companies like AB Bieren N.V., helping them evaluate whether an investment will meet the necessary returns to satisfy both debt obligations and equity expectations. By breaking down WACC's components and experimenting with factors such as capital structure and interest rates, companies can make informed choices, optimising their financing approach to align with strategic goals.</p>
    
    <p>But as we uncovered, calculating WACC isn't merely about numbers. It's about aligning the cost of capital with the intended purpose of the investment. <span class="cfo-tip">Ultimately, WACC encourages businesses to use capital wisely and strategically, driving growth in ways that create sustainable value</span>. With this tool, companies can approach each investment opportunity not just with financial prudence but with an eye toward the future—a future where every investment serves a purpose beyond profit alone.</p>
