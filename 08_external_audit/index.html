<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Building Trust, Credibility and Financial Integrity</li>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the world of startups, <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">trust is a valuable currency</mark></strong>. External audits contribute significantly to building trust and credibility among various stakeholders. Further, these professionals bring an unbiased and independent perspective to the financial reporting process. By meticulously examining a startup's financial statements, auditors provide <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">assurance </mark></strong>to stakeholders, investors, and the broader business community. Investors, lenders, and partners are more likely to engage with a startup that has undergone external scrutiny, as it demonstrates a commitment to <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">transparency and accountability</mark></strong>. This increased trust can lead to enhanced relationships and improved access to capital, both critical elements for a startup's growth.</p>

<li>Compliance with Regulations</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Navigating the regulatory landscape can be a daunting task for startups, especially considering the evolving nature of financial regulations. External auditors bring a <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">wealth of knowledge and expertise</mark></strong> in staying abreast of these regulations. By ensuring compliance with accounting standards and legal requirements, auditors help startups avoid legal pitfalls and financial penalties, fostering a culture of transparency and adherence to best practices</p>

<li>Enhanced Decision-Making</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accurate financial information is the bedrock of sound decision-making. External audits provide startups with a <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">clear and unbiased view</mark></strong> of their financial position. Armed with reliable data, entrepreneurs and management teams can make informed decisions about resource allocation, strategic planning, and overall business direction.

<li>Risk Mitigation</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Startups often operate in a high-risk environment where uncertainties abound. External auditors play a crucial role in <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">identifying and mitigating financial risks</mark></strong>. Through a comprehensive risk assessment, auditors can uncover potential issues, such as internal control weaknesses or accounting irregularities, allowing startups to address these concerns proactively. This risk mitigation not only safeguards the financial health of the startup but also protects the interests of investors and other stakeholders.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading h2-blog">Obligation of Auditor Appointment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Belgian regulations some companies are obligated to appoint an auditor. The Belgian regulation is as follows: <em>A company or a non-profit organization/foundation is deemed to be large and must appoint an auditor if it exceeds at least two of the following criteria for two consecutive financial years</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Annual average number of <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">employees </mark></strong>exceeds fifty (anno 2024)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Annual <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><strong>turnover </strong></mark>(excluding VAT) exceeds €9,000,000 (anno 2024)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Balance sheet total</mark></strong> exceeds €4,500,000 (anno 2024)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The appointment of the auditor occurs from the financial year after the financial year during which two of the criteria were exceeded twice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For companies, non-profit organizations and foundations starting their business, the above criteria are estimated in good faith at the beginning of the financial year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Small listed companies, small companies that are organisations of public interest and companies that are part of a group that must consolidate (Article 141, 2° Companies Code / Art. 3:72, 2° Companies Code) are always obliged to appoint an auditor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other entities that are not required to appoint an auditor can do so on a voluntary basis for the following reasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading h2-blog">Audit Procedures and Role of CFOrent</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An audit involves a series of procedures designed to assess the financial statements and provides an independent opinion on their fairness and compliance with accounting standards. Here's an <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">overview of the key procedures</mark></strong> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">performed by external auditors and how CFOrent can assist on these topics</mark></strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: The auditor starts by understanding the company’s business environment and identifies specific risks associated with it. This process helps to tailor their audit approach to focus on areas with the highest risk of material misstatements. Our role in this is to <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">assist the auditor by illustrating the recent industry trends</mark></strong> and justifying the measures taken to cope these potential related risks.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Understanding Internal Controls</strong>: The auditor assesses the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. A strong internal control system reduces the risk of errors or fraud in financial reporting. Auditors may test and evaluate key controls to ensure they are operating as intended. The support that CFOrent can provide is to <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">conduct a comprehensive internal review before the audit</mark></strong>. This step involves thorough analysis of the financial figures, addressing any previous findings, and fortifying internal controls. The insights gained from this process not only contribute to a smoother external audit but also offer a blueprint for companies looking to enhance their internal review mechanisms.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Substantive Procedures</strong>: The most intensive part of the audit are the substantive procedures. Auditors perform substantive procedures on the fiscal year closing figures to gather evidence about the accuracy and completeness of the financial information. The procedures include:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Substantive Analytical Procedures: Auditors use a variety of analytical tools and techniques to assess the reasonableness of financial information. This includes comparing financial ratios, industry benchmarks, and trends over time.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Test of Details: Examining specific transactions, account balances, and disclosures to ensure they are accurately presented. The auditor selects a sample of transactions, such as sales, purchases, or expenses, and perform detailed testing to verify their accuracy. This may involve confirming transactions with third parties, examining supporting documentation, and assessing the proper recording of these transactions in the accounting records.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Inventory Observation: For companies with significant inventory, auditors may physically observe the counting and valuation of inventory to ensure it is accurately    reflected in the financial statements.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Legal and Compliance Review: Auditors review the company's compliance with relevant laws and regulations. This may include tax compliance, adherence to contractual agreements, and industry-specific regulations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list --></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To prepare for these substantive procedures we take <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">a proactive approach by ensuring all financial records</mark></strong>, from balance sheets to income statements and supporting documentation, are organized and readily accessible. This not only expedites the audit process but serves as a foundation for companies looking to enhance their own documentation practices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Further, we commit to <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">providing auditors with requested information promptly</mark></strong>. This commitment to timeliness not only streamlines the audit process but sets a benchmark for companies seeking timely insights into their financial figures. In the fast-paced business world, quick access to accurate data is paramount for informed decision-making.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"className":"wp-block-heading h2-blog"} -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading h2-blog">Materiality</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Materiality is a critical concept in auditing and refers to <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">the significance or importance of an item, transaction, or discrepancy in financial statements</mark></strong>. Materiality is applied by auditors throughout the above audit process and is used by auditors to determine the scope of their procedures and the focus of their attention on areas where misstatements could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Materiality is also considered when evaluating the effect of identified misstatements, determining whether they warrant adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In practice, auditors establish materiality thresholds based on various factors such as the size and nature of the entity, its industry norms, regulatory requirements, and the users' informational needs. These thresholds serve as benchmarks to determine whether a misstatement or error could influence the economic decisions of financial statement users. Auditors may calculate materiality as a percentage of financial statement items such as total assets, revenues, or net income. Also, auditors consider factors like the nature of the misstatement, its potential impact on stakeholders, and the overall context of the financial reporting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading h2-blog">Final Meeting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final meeting following an audit is a <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">pivotal moment</mark></strong> where the auditor presents their findings and conclusions to the client's management team and key stakeholders. This meeting typically serves to discuss the audit results, address any significant issues or concerns identified during the audit process, and outline the next steps.<br>&nbsp;<br>During the meeting, the auditor <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">begins by</mark></strong> <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">summarizing </mark></strong>the scope of the audit, the procedures performed, and the key areas of focus.

The auditor may also highlight areas of strength and commendable practices observed during the audit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout the discussion, the auditor <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">provides explanations and clarifications</mark></strong> as needed, ensuring that the client's management team fully understands the audit results and their implications. This dialogue fosters transparency and open communication between the auditor and the client, promoting a constructive exchange of information.<br>&nbsp;<br>Following the presentation of findings, the final meeting often includes a discussion of <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">recommendations for improvement and suggestions</mark></strong> for remedial actions to address identified issues. The auditor may provide guidance on best practices and offer insights into areas where the client can enhance their financial reporting processes and internal controls. Additionally, the final meeting may involve a review of the auditor's formal report.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the findings from these procedures, auditors issue an audit report expressing their opinion on whether the financial statements present <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">a true and fair view</mark></strong> in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.</p>
