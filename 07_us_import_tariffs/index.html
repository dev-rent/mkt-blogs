  <section id="introduction">
    <p><strong class="cfo-tip">Hot from the press</strong> are the developments surrounding the U.S. import tariffs, dominating the news since last week. And even more than stable import tariffs, businesses despise periods of instability.</p>
    <p>It obstructs strategic and operational planning, uncertainty leads to indecisiveness and it takes some <em>cool heads</em> to navigate the crisis. But <em>never waste a good crisis</em>! So CFOrent is happy to share our expertise and insights to entrepreneurs looking for options amid the current turmoil.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-blog">Are the Tariffs Definitive?</h2>

    <p>Decisions in board rooms will depend on each member's interpretation of the current situation. That the height and reach of the import tariffs have even surprised Wall Street, should be an indication that many thought this was just another round of bluff and grandstanding. Entrepreneurs now need to choose which scenario they want to believe:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Scenario 1</strong>: This is a <strong class="cfo-tip">short term negotiation tactic</strong> to bully some trade partners into better deals for the US (e.g. Tik Tok). When a few first easy wins can be announced, and as inflation starts flaring up, most of these tariffs will be reduced. If you believe this scenario, no harm in riding out the storm and waiting until Q3 to further make up your mind. Historically speaking, this would not be the first time that it happens.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario 2</strong>: It really is a <strong class="cfo-tip">long term policy</strong>, driven by a philosophy that industrial reshoring and reduced dependency from countries, like China, is worth the economic pain. This scenario would imply that logistics flows need to be redrawn, also for companies that were just starting to have significant US sales. If and when a certain level of tariffs prove sustainable on the long term, only then your company can realistically assess local investments and reshoring production. </li>
    </ol>

  <section id="review-catalogue">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Review Your Catalogue</h2>

    <p>An import tariff will suddenly make US goods seem more competitively priced than foreign goods. In reality, the American consumer will just pay more for any good, foreign or domestic, and therefore can afford to spend less. The supply-demand curve will find a new equilibrium, and thus, it does not automatically dictate that you will have to drop prices by the amount of the tariff in order to stay competitive.</p>
    
    <p>It is important to note that <strong class="cfo-tip">only goods are impacted</strong>, not services. In many cases, a sale includes a pre- or post-sales service (think broad, such as software upgrades, repairs, education, etc). <strong class="cfo-tip">Reassess pricing, and potentially unbundle the services from the goods</strong>.</p>

    <p>Carefully <strong class="cfo-tip">assess the customs product classification</strong> you are importing under, these can be found <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/" rel="noopener nofollower noreferrer">here</a>. A reclassification, combined with the division of services and goods, can benefit the tax burden for your company.</p>

    <p>Large orders of goods are likely to be <strong class="cfo-tip">delayed or reduced</strong>. If your company heavily depends on maintaining stock, <strong class="cfo-tip">it is time to update your financial outlook.</strong></p>

  <section id="dollar-as-currency">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Dollar as Reserve Currency</h2>

    <p>The Federal Reserve System (commonly known as "the Fed") has three key objectives: <em>maximising employment</em>, <em> stabilising prices</em> and <em>moderating long-term interest rates</em>. In practice, this means the institution battles inflation and stimulates growth.</p>

    <p>The expected raise in prices will fuel inflation, but, this might actually be <strong class="cfo-tip">part of a greater plan to weaken the dollar</strong>. This will make US production more competitive for domestic companies.</p>

    <p>In the search for political gain, let us not underestimate the political pressure to <strong class="cfo-tip">not increase interest rates in exchange for more employment</strong>. In turn, it is our prediction, the US dollar will slide even further and <strong class="cfo-tip">managing currency risk</strong> becomes more relevant.</p>

  <section id="balancing-import-tariffs-transfer-pricing-income-tax">
    <h2 class="h2-blog">Import Tariffs, Transfer Pricing and Income Tax</h2>
    <p>All three share a dynamic bond, so if one of them is adjusted, so should the others. When you are selling goods to your own US subsidiary, before delivering tem to your end consumer, your business will likely have a Transfer Pricing contract (TP) in place.</p> 

    <blockquote>
      <p>Let us assume your business has a typical Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) setup, where the U.S. entity earns a routine margin on it's operating costs.</p>
      <p>When import tariffs increase the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), this margin can be eroded, making it appear less profitable or even loss-making. Now the details on incoterms and contractual division of risk and reward become very relevant.</p>
      <p>To-Do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work out at which cost your goods enter the country. Remember that <strong class="cfo-tip">transfer pricing does not automatically serve as the declared transaction value at the border.</strong></li>
        <li>Review the transfer pricing.</li>
        <li>Re-evaluate the tax burden of the import tariffs. Depending on your transfer pricing contract, the import tariffs can reduce the income tax in either the U.S. or Belgium.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A <strong class="cfo-tip">proactive Transfer Pricing review</strong> is advised to ensure the U.S. entity's profitability remains within an acceptable arm's length range, even with inflated import prices.</p>
