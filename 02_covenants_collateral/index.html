  <section id="introduction">
    <p>In the dynamic landscape of the Belgian finance, but broader also the European, securing a loan involves navigating through a maze of regulations, negotiations, and financial obstacles. In our experience, the <strong class="cfo-tip">general perception today is that acquiring a loan seems more difficult</strong>, takes longer and comes with more and more conditions in order to get approval. Whether it's for business expansion or to increase liquidity, understanding the fundamentals of a loan agreement is crucial for entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level. This article aims to highlight <strong class="cfo-tip">two key aspects of loan agreements: covenants and collateral</strong>.</p>

    <p>Securing favourable terms and conditions is of great importance for your business when aiming to gain more autonomy and more flexibility to succeed your business as you intended to. In our <a href="https://cforent.com/news-and-insights/planning-growth-based-on-interest-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a>, we <strong class="cfo-tip">highlighted the impact of interest rates</strong> on your business. Today, we <strong class="cfo-tip">dive deeper</strong> in these <strong class="cfo-tip">less-known features of a loan</strong> and find out whether our perception of more<strong class="cfo-tip"> strict conditions on loan agreements </strong>matches the feedback given, by banks, in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) conducted by the European Central Bank.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-blog">The Bank Lending Survey</h2>

    <p><strong class="cfo-tip">Each quarter</strong>, the European Central Bank holds a <strong class="cfo-tip">questionnaire</strong> among European banks and compares the results with the previous quarter. The questions are qualitative and range from "having tightened/increased considerably" and "somewhat tightened/increased" to "somewhat eased/decreased" and "having eased/decreased considerably". The <strong class="cfo-tip">responses are converted</strong> in numbers by means of a <strong>diffusion index</strong> and a <strong>net percentage</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Diffusion index (DINX) is the difference between the weighted sum of positive responses vs. negative responses.</li>
      <li>Net percentage (FNET) is the difference between the sum of positive responses vs. negative responses, in percentages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The net percentage depicts an absolute difference between positive and negative responses. The diffusion index is a more nuanced indication because it adds weights of 0.5 and 1 to the responses "somewhat" and "considerably".</p>
    
    <p>The findings of the Bank Lending Survey are subject to the banks' perspectives and may not necessarily reflect how the general public perceives these conditions.

    <h2 class="h2-blog"><strong>Take Control over Covenants</strong></h2>

    <p><strong class="cfo-tip">Covenants are additional conditions of a loan agreement</strong>. They outline the terms and conditions under which a borrower must operate during the loan duration. These conditions <strong class="cfo-tip">serve to protect the lender's interests</strong> by mitigating risks associated with default or financial instability. Covenants can be broadly categorised into positive covenants and negative covenants, and qualitative and quantitative covenants</p>

    <p><strong class="cfo-tip">Positive covenants</strong> require the borrower to fulfil certain actions or meet specific financial targets. Concrete examples are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Meeting a certain solvency ratio, which is quantitative.</li>
      <li>Minimum Net worth, which can be equity minus intangible assets, which is quantitative.</li>
      <li>Submission of the annual reports to the bank, which is qualitative.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On the other hand, <strong class="cfo-tip">negative covenants</strong> restrict a borrower from taking certain actions that could jeopardise the lender's position. These may include limitations on additional borrowing, restrictions on asset sales, or constraints on dividend payments. Concrete examples are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Negative pledge clause, which prohibits your business from providing stronger collateral to a third-party. It's qualitative.</li>
      <li>The cross-default clause, which gives the lender the right to suspend all loans with the business if one covenant is not fulfilled. It's also qualitative.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's essential for borrowers to <strong class="cfo-tip">thoroughly review and understand covenant requirements before agreeing to a loan</strong>. Failure to meet covenant obligations can trigger penalties, such as increased interest rates, higher collateral or termination of contract. Thus jeopardising the financial health of your business. Small business owners should therefore carefully assess their ability to comply with covenant terms before entering into a loan agreement.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong class="cfo-tip">CFOrent Tip</strong>: Covenants are negotiable. If you do not agree with certain covenants, negotiate other terms. Think win-win; the bank will be more inclined to accept your counteroffer if they feel you are being reasonable.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">Summary Covenants Data</h3>

    <p>The overall pattern in the data indicates that Belgian banks have shifted from easing covenant conditions to tightening them since mid-2019. This adjustment appears to align with broader economic trends influenced by factors such as COVID-19 and rising interest rates. Interestingly, Belgian banks relaxed covenant requirements for large enterprises in the third quarter of 2023, potentially signalling increased trust and offering a potential precedent for SMEs.</p>

    <p><strong class="cfo-tip">Collateral </strong>is an unwanted, but sometimes, <strong class="cfo-tip">obligatory condition</strong> in a loan agreement, serving as a form of security for lenders <strong class="cfo-tip">to mitigate the risk</strong> of default. In essence, collateral is an asset or assets pledged by the borrower to the lender, which the lender can seize and sell in the event of non-payment. The type of collateral accepted can vary depending on the lender's policies, the nature of the loan, and the financial strength of the borrower.</p>

    <p>Collateral can take <strong class="cfo-tip">various forms</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real Estate: Property owned by the business, such as land, buildings, or commercial premises.</li>
      <li>Equipment and Machinery: Tangible assets such as machinery, vehicles, or specialized equipment.</li>
      <li>Inventory: For businesses with substantial inventory holdings, such as retailers or wholesalers.</li>
      <li>Accounts Receivable: Outstanding invoices owed to the business by customers.</li>
      <li>Intellectual Property: Intellectual property assets, such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is a <strong class="cfo-tip">misunderstanding that</strong>, when presented with a loan agreement, <strong class="cfo-tip">collateral is not negotiable</strong>. Real Estate is a common example of collateral, but the devil is in the details. How much are you going to loan, and do you know the value of your property? Why give a property with a value of one million euro as collateral if you only intend to loan seven hundred thousand euros. And should there be troubles in the future, how fast can the bank call upon it's collateral?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong class="cfo-tip">CFOrent Tip</strong>: Negotiate with the bank for a cap on the value of your property, for example €500k for a loan of €700k. And secure a certain period of time that allows you to sell your property first.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It's essential for small business owners and start-ups to carefully evaluate their available collateral and understand the implications of pledging assets to secure a loan. By leveraging collateral effectively, businesses can <strong class="cfo-tip">increase </strong>their chances of accessing <strong class="cfo-tip">financing at favourable terms</strong> while minimising the lender's risk. However, borrowers should also be aware of the potential consequences of default, including the loss of pledged assets<strong class="cfo-tip">. Collaborating with financial advisors and legal experts can help </strong>businesses navigate the collateral process and make informed decisions that align with their long-term growth objectives.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-blog">Summary Collateral Data</h3>

    <p>Collateral significantly impacts businesses of all sizes. Since mid-2019, there has been a noticeable trend among banks demanding more collateral. Following the 2008 crisis, collateral requirements tightened, particularly for SMEs. From 2015 to late 2018, there was a general easing of these requirements. However, recent economic trends indicate a resurgence in the demand for collateral.</p>

    <p>It is worth noting that tightening and easing of clauses like covenants and collateral follow roughly the <a href="https://cforent.com/news-and-insights/planning-growth-based-on-interest-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general trend of the interest rates</a>, with more tightening when interest rates are high and easing when they are low.</p>

  <section id="europe-sets-the-tone">
    <h2 class="h2-blog"><strong>Europe Sets the Tone</strong></h2>

    <p>Euro area banks tightened credit standards for loans to enterprises in Q4 2023, adding to cumulative tightening since 2022 and contributing to weak loan growth. This tightening, mainly driven by German and smaller euro area banks, moderated compared to the previous quarter and was below historical averages. Risk perceptions continued to tighten credit standards, while factors like banks' cost of funds and competition had a neutral effect. Weak economic conditions and credit risks for firms were cited as main reasons for the tightening impact. However, banks' own financial situations and market financing costs did not contribute to further tightening, with some banks even reporting an easing impact on market financing access.</p>

    <p>At times, <strong class="cfo-tip">Belgian banks</strong> show modest independence and do things differently compared to other European banks. But <strong class="cfo-tip">most of the time, they go along with the general flow</strong>. Once in a while, though, they go in the opposite direction.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-blog">CFO-tips for Successful Loan Application</h2>

    <p>In addition to <strong class="cfo-tip">understanding </strong>the nuances of loan terms such as covenants and collateral, SME's and start-ups must also grasp the intricate <strong class="cfo-tip">process of applying for loans</strong>. While the financial assistance provided by banks can fuel growth and expansion, the journey to securing a loan can be daunting, especially for those new to the entrepreneurial landscape.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong class="cfo-tip">Preparation is Key</strong>: Before embarking on the loan application journey, it's crucial that you meticulously prepare your documentation. Banks typically require a range of financial statements, business plans, cash flow projections, and personal guarantees. Ensuring these documents are accurate, up-to-date, and professionally presented can significantly enhance the chances of loan approve.
      </li>
      <li><strong class="cfo-tip">Explore Alternative Funding</strong>: While traditional banks remain a common source of business financing, SMEs and start-ups can also explore alternative lending options. Fintech companies, peer-to-peer lending platforms, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs) offer alternative avenues for accessing capital, often with more flexible eligibility criteria and faster approval processes.</li>
      <li><strong class="cfo-tip">Build Strong Relationships</strong>: Establishing and nurturing relationships with financial institutions can be invaluable for your business when seeking loans. By cultivating connections with bankers, financial advisors, and industry experts, businesses can gain insights into available financing options, receive guidance on loan application processes, and potentially secure more favourable terms. Regularly keep your bank informed on how the business is going, by sending them interim results. They're likely to return the favour when times are more turbulent.</li>
      <li><strong class="cfo-tip">Demonstrate Growth and Knowledge</strong>: When presenting a loan application, you should emphasise your growth potential and market viability. Banks are more likely to support businesses with clear growth strategies, sustainable revenue streams, and a solid understanding of their target market. Highlighting past achievements, future projections, and competitive advantages can instill confidence in lenders and strengthen loan applications.</li>
      <li><strong class="cfo-tip">Seek Professional Guidance</strong>: Navigating the complexities of loan applications can be overwhelming, especially for those with limited financial expertise. Seeking guidance from financial advisors can provide invaluable support throughout the loan application process. Professionals can offer insights into financial management, assist with loan documentation, and help businesses make informed decisions aligned with their long-term objectives.</li>
